Hi!
Thanks for choosing to use our application

Our program is designed to give companies who distribute food by shipping it to their 
customers a easy and simple way to keep track of their customers and their information.

The application does this by giving the user the option to add customers to a list where
they are stored along with others. Then the application alows the user to choose one of
the people in the list and click them to view all the personal information that is needed.
If any person were to change name or such, there is a feature that can update information
that is stored within one of the customers. If they wish to cancel the delivery or anything 
in that way, there is a delete button that deletes all the information and removes the customer 
from the customerlist.

If you would like to find a specific person, there is a search feature that looks at the 
social security number that is specified in the customers information page.
